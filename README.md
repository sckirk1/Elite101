# Elite101
This repo is going to be used as an example for the Elite101 Code2College class for the Fall of 2023. This will hopefully give students and idea of how to collaborate, organize, and push their code to a VCS. 

# Project Goal
This project will be a python based fractal generator, that uses numPy and matplotlib to create fractals. 

# Usage
To run the fractal generator use the command: 
'python fractalGenerator.py'
