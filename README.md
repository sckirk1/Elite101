# Elite101
This repo is going to be used as an example for the Elite101 Code2College class for the Fall of 2024. This will hopefully give students and idea of how to collaborate, organize, and push their code to a VCS. 

# Project Goal
This project will be a collection of scripts and functions of mathematical games

# Examples
#### Fractal Generator
Make sure both numPy and matplotlib are installed in the python environment, then run `python examples/fractal.py` from the examples folder. It will prompt for a number of points that will be used as "anchor points" for the process of generating the fractal. The general algorithm for *n* anchor points is as follows:
1. Pick any point on the plane to start at 
2. Choose an anchor point at random
3. Move some percent towards the anchor point from where you are
4. Mark down that new point
5. Repeat steps 2-4, the more times you repeat the better the "resolution" of the resulting fractal will be

6. This is a test
