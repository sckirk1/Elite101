# Concepts
This directory contains python files for different programming concepts. The goal of these files is to provide a simple, annotated, explaination for what these concepts are, and how they are implemented in python. The code should be relatively generic, and limited in scope to just that topic. This should allow for less confusing examples as well being easier to find information on a specific topic. 

## Order
Though there is not a direct dependency in the python code from one file to another, going through for the first time still benefits from looking at some topics prior to others. A recommended order that should provide enough background before going into each subsequent file is as follows:
