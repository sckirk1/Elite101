# Mini Projects
This directory contains scripts and programs that combine the concepts from the other folder into functional, more complicated examples. These examples will show how the concepts can combine to solve problems, make games, and create scripts of a range of topics. Each file will have a comment at the top instructing on how to run each file and which dependencies may be needed. That information will also be found below in each subsection for the individiual project.
